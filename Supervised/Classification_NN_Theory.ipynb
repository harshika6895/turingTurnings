    "WHAT MAKES UP A CLASSIFICATION MODEL? \n",
    "\n",
    "The classification model break up into 3 parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)THE STRUCTURE OF THE MODEL : We use a threshold on a single feature\n",
    "\n",
    "2)THE SEARCH PROCEDURE : We tru every possible combination of feature and threshold \n",
    "\n",
    "3)THE LOSS FUNCTION: Using the loss function we decide which of the possibilities is less bad. We want the loss function to be minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Playing around with these 3 parts gives us the best model to work with. We can attempt to build the threshold with minimum training error, but we will only test 3 values for every feature which are mean value of the feature, the mean plus one standard deviation and the mean minus one standard deviation.\n",
    "Alternatively we can also have different loss functions because it might be the case that one type of error is more costly than another. For eg. in medical settings false positives and false negatives are not equivalent.Same with spam filterling, deleting a non-spam-email which is false negative error is much dangerous for the user that getting a spam mail through which is false positive and is not that big of a deal.\n",

    "A MORE COMPLEX DATASET - SEEDS DATASET \n",
    "\n",
    "In this dataset we have data about the seed of 3 species of wheat. There are 7 features given : Area , Perimeter , Compactness of the kernel(C = 4piA/P^2) , Length of kernel , width of kernel, Asymmetry coefficient, Length of kernel groove. The Three classes of wheat are CANADIAN, KOMA and ROSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "FEATURES AND FEATURE ENGINEERING : Feature engineering is not so fancy but is important. In this we derive a new combined feature from our given features increasing the performance. For eg in the seed dataset compactness is a derived feature from area and perimeter is a typical feature for shapes. This feature will have the same value for two kernels, oone of which is twice as big as the other one but with the same shape. However they will have different values for kernels with different shapes like for round and elongated one.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature engineering is done to get a good feature. The good feature is the once which simultaneously varies with what matters and be invariant with what doesnt. To know the good feature you must have some background knowldege to intuit which will be the good feature. There are several problem domains where there is already a vast literature for possible features and types that we can build upon, but you can always use your knowledge of the specific problem to design a specific feature. \"Even Before you have data, you must decide which data is worthwhile to collect.\n",
    "\n",
    "FEATURE SELECTION : The problem that whether we can select the good feature automatically. There are many methods which work for the problem but very simple ideas works the best.\n",
